Our chapter of Amnesty International at Longwood High School is representative of the ideas of Amnesty International everywhere. We discuss ways we can help ensure the protection of human rights within our community, and also within the international community as well. We seek not only to ensure the protection of human rights, but also to increase the standard of living for as many people as possible. As we start a new year we hope to work hard to &quot;be the change we want to see in the world.&quot; <br>

      The  Yearbook Club is a great one to get involved in.  The group meets throughout the week as  needed.  Every year, the staff creates  the next edition of the Yearbook, with a few students from each grade working  to create their individual pages.   Photographers take candid pictures for use in the class pages, artists  make their creations and decorate the book in and out, and writers can use  their words to help us all remember each year that passes.  Those interested in the business aspect of  the Yearbook can use their skills to keep track of sales, information records,  and advertising.  All are welcome.
